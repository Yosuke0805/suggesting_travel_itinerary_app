ðŸ›« [Application to suggest travel itinerary](https://lets-make-travel-itinerary-together.streamlit.app/)

# Background
Since I am a huge fun of traveling, I always spend a bunch of time of what to do during travel in my spare time.
So, I created the app to suggest travel itinerary and what to do based on the destination.
This app utilizes Gemini model so it requires Gemini API which is free of charge!!
You can generate your Gemini API key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

# How to use it
1. Generate Gemini API key.
2. Click 'Others' and input Gemini APi key on sidebar.
3. Input your duration, destination, departure date. If you already decided next destination, input it too.
4. Click "Generate Itinerary" button.
